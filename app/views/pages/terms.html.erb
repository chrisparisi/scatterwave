              informed of the possibility of such damage, even if a limited remedy set forth herein is found to have
              failed of its essential purpose. Except for our obligations to pay amounts to applicable Hosts pursuant
              to these Terms or an approved payment request under the Scatterwave Host Guarantee, in no event will
              Scatterwave aggregate liability arising out of or in connection with these Terms and your use of the
              Scatterwave Platform including, but not limited to, from your publishing or booking of any Listings via

              Content and in connection with any Accommodation, Experiences, Event or other Host Service, or

              Scatterwave Platform as a Guest in the twelve (12) month period prior to the event giving rise to the
              liability, or if you are a Host, the amounts paid by Scatterwave to you in the twelve (12) month period

              payments have been made, as applicable. The limitations of damages set forth above are fundamental
              elements of the basis of the bargain between Scatterwave and you. Some jurisdictions do not allow the
              exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the above limitation
              may not apply to you. If you reside outside of the U.S., this does not affect Scatterwave liability for
              death or personal injury arising from its negligence, nor for fraudulent misrepresentation,
              misrepresentation as to a fundamental matter or any other liability which cannot be excluded or limited
